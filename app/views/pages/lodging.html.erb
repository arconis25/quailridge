               Our New Lodge was completed for the 99-00 season and has been complimented by many guests.  It features a commercial kitchen, large dining room, comfortable lounge, wrap-around deck, and a new gift shop.  It's modern design and construction brings all the conveniences of home.  From its restaurant style kitchen our experienced cook staff turns out three southern style meals every day.  Our fare includes the expected grits, southern fried chicken, grilled steak, and  fried quail along with many surprises.
